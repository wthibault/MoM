INSTALL.txt
===========

These are instructions for building the CSUEB Virtual String Simulator from source code.
It's not very simple, since you have to build the (static) libraries needed.
These are not all needed on all platforms.

libfftw3 (3.3.3)
glut (3.7.6)
glew (1.9.0)
RtAudio-4.0.10
FLTK (1.3.2)

Most of these can be installed in Ubuntu with apt-get or the like.
They are also included with the source code as archives (either in string-apparatus folder or its win32/ssg-lib subfolder).
(This varies with platform. Check the Makefile too. XXX DETAILS PLEASE. XXX)

To compile:
git clone https://github.com/wthibault/MoM
cd MoM/string-apparatus
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ssg
make
cd ../string-apparatus
[build/install the libraries]
make
./string-apparatus

(if it fails with a message about not connecting to audio,
run "amixer" and exit to tickle ALSA, then try again.)
